# TranslexAline
translex-align is a minimal, verifiable prototype for cross-lexicon semantic alignment using 7-axis AQL vectors, dimi-ÆXIE micro-shear regularization, and Sinkhorn OT. It targets reproducible coupling discovery between distant micro-lexicons with measurable cosine gain aswell as non-obvious equivalence and insight..
