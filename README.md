# TranslexAline
translex-align is a minimal, verifiable prototype for cross-lexicon semantic alignment using 7-axis AQL vectors, dimi-ÆXIE micro-shear regularization, and Sinkhorn OT. It targets reproducible coupling discovery between distant micro-lexicons with measurable cosine gain aswell as non-obvious equivalence and insight..
# translex-align

Minimal working nucleus of the Trans-Lexiconic Concordance

A prototype for cross-lexicon semantic alignment using:
- 7-axis AQL qualitative vectorization
- dimi-ÆXIE micro-tilt regularization
- Sinkhorn–Knopp optimal transport
- Measurable cosine similarity gain and emergent couplings

Goal by Dec 21 2025:
- 21 real entries from two micro-lexicons (current candidates: Koine Greek theological terms ↔ Toki Pona compounds)
- Full pipeline in Python (vectors → tilt → OT → alignment)
- Live Streamlit demo showing before/after vectors and at least one non-obvious revealed equivalence
- Public, verifiable, reproducible

Status: Day 0 – Nov 22 2025 – foundation poured.

If this ships on time, it becomes the seed of a geometric-metaphysical translator.  
If it doesn’t, we admit the vision outran the vessel and downscope honorably.

No poetry until the numbers breathe.
